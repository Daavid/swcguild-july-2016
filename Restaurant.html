Founder Joe Patane and family ran out of food halfway through the evening on their first night, indicating his hunch about Neopolitan-style pizza and its popularity was correct. The third generation of Joe's family invites you to share in a part of Omaha's restaurant heritage known as La Casa, still operating in our original location at 4432 Leavenworth Street.</td>
